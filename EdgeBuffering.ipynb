    "# Python implementation of efficient edge recording\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "* Forward simulations still have trouble scaling\n",
    "* I showed how to parallelize simplification, but we are still\n",
    "  \"leaving performance on the table\" for the fundamental operations.\n",
    "* fwdpp has had a more efficient edge buffering method for over two years.\n",
    "* I presented it at one of the first tskit-dev meetings, but the feeling\n",
    "  was that it may be too specific (only applying to forward sims).\n",
    "  * I no longer agree -- the performance benefits are really big\n",
    "    and this type of sim is a core use for tskit-c.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "* I want to move fwdpy11 from using fwdpp's tables to tskit's.\n",
    "  * Reason: to output, we make a copy from fwdpp tables to tskit tables.\n",
    "    * In practice, we seem to always use less memory than SLiM, even\n",
    "      with this extra copy. However, this copying will bite us in the butt at some point\n",
    "      as simulations get larger and larger (N + total genetic map length).\n",
    "  * Reason 2: fwdpp has been a good testing ground for new ideas, but I can do\n",
    "    the same kinda experimentation more easily with my \"top secret\" [fwdpp replacement](https://github.com/ForwardSimulation/forrustts/)\n",
    "* We don't want to lose performance.\n",
    "* The barriers are:\n",
    "  * Sorting tables...\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Recent progress\n",
    "\n",
    "* Port the fwdpp edge buffer to tskit-rust.\n",
    "  * This is an open PR.\n",
    "  * The functionality is feature-gated.\n",
    "  * This PR gives the `buffering` results in the benchmark plots.\n",
    "  * Results are good, but arguably not great.\n",
    "  * Recording API is inelegant due to inner workings of simplification:\n",
    "    * The edge table validation uses stricter criteria than what \n",
    "      the algorithm requires.\n",
    "    * The buffering API needs to do extra steps to buffer segments by \n",
    "      child. In practice, hashing seems the best way to do this, making\n",
    "      it difficult to port back to C.\n",
    "    * We also need to bulk copy from the buffer to the tables prior to simplification.\n",
    "      This copying is unnecessary, inelegant, and hurts performance.\n",
    "* Stack a PR on top of the one described above.\n",
    "  * This PR must never be merged into tskit-rust.\n",
    "  * Add functionality to the C API to allow manual control over the simplification\n",
    "    steps.\n",
    "  * These tskit-c changes allow us to avoid all the API ugliness described above.\n",
    "  * **None of the internal tskit-c simplification machinery gets leaked due to applying the \"PIMPL idiom\"**\n",
    "  * This PR gives the `buffering_streaming` benchmark results.\n",
    "  * Full disclosure: this PR is not fully optimised. \n",
    "    It does too much work, has at least one allocation during simplification that can be removed, etc.. \n",
    "    Stacking it on the previous PR and then hacking led to some sub-optimal design re:the edge buffers inner workings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Limitations of the rust prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As simulation epochs get longer, we retain performance benefits but memory savings are not as good.\n",
    "   This behavior is due to the capacity doubling behavior of `Vec`.\n",
    "   It is easy to change this:\n",
    "   * Allow a `max_capacity_increase` field.\n",
    "   * Allow capacity doubling until a doubling is a larger than `max_capacity_increase`, at which\n",
    "     point we rely on [Vec::reserve_exact](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reserve_exact)\n",
    "     prior to any calls to `push`.\n",
    "   * We can play analagos games in `tskit-c` with `realloc`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## The Python prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is a Python prototype that does everything except one step that is needed to correctly handle non-overlapping generations.\n",
    "That step is described in words at the bottom of this notebook."
